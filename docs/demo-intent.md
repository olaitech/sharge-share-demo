DEMO INTENT – SHARGE SHARE

Core idea:
Sharge Share is a concept marketplace for sharing private home EV chargers.
It is not about speed or infrastructure.
It is about access, trust, and availability in residential areas.

This demo exists to show:
- That private home charging is a different category than public fast charging
- That time-based availability and human-scale context matter
- That the concept is closer to Airbnb than to Tesla Superchargers

What this demo is:
- A UX and product concept demonstration
- A realistic representation of how the service could work
- Something that helps a visitor “get it” in under 60 seconds

What this demo is NOT:
- Not a finished product
- Not a technical MVP
- Not a SaaS dashboard
- Not a map-heavy app
- Not a payment or account system

Primary user roles (conceptual, no accounts):
1. Driver
   - Looking for a nearby home charger
   - Cares about availability, price, and trust
2. Host
   - Has a private charger at home
   - Wants simple visibility and predictable usage

What to prioritize in the demo:
1. Charger availability
   - Time-based availability windows
   - Clear indication of when a charger can be used
2. Simple pricing
   - Price per hour
   - No complex fees
3. Trust signals
   - Human-readable names
   - Location context (neighborhood / area, not exact address)
   - Calm, non-aggressive UI

What to avoid completely:
- Maps
- GPS
- Real-time positioning
- Payments
- User accounts
- Onboarding flows
- Ratings systems beyond a simple indicator
- Anything that feels like “growth hacking” or a finished SaaS

Visual and interaction tone:
- Calm
- Scandinavian / practical
- Neutral and trustworthy
- No flashy animations
- Focus on clarity over novelty

Success criteria:
If a visitor understands what Sharge Share is,
how it differs from public charging,
and why private charging is useful,
within 60 seconds,
the demo is successful.
